        <h2>Journal Overview</h2>
        <p>This journal documents key learnings, reflections, and experiences gained during the Enterprise IT Project Management module.</p>
<h3>Unit 1 â€“ Introduction to Cloud Fundamentals and Services</h3>
<p>Unit 1 developed a foundational understanding of cloud computing, focusing on its evolution,
core service models, and impact on modern IT. Learning about IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS clarified how
responsibility is distributed between providers and customers, helping to evaluate which model best
suits organisational needs. This unit also encouraged reflection on the balance between scalability,
cost efficiency, and security, which often determine successful adoption. The formative discussion
comparing AWS and Google Cloud deepened this insight by contrasting flexibility, pricing, and use
cases. It became clear that provider selection depends less on brand and more on aligning
capabilities with strategic goals and workload demands.</p>
