        <h2>Journal Overview</h2>
        <p>This journal documents key learnings, reflections, and experiences gained during the Enterprise IT Project Management module.</p>
<h3>Unit 1 – Introduction to Cloud Fundamentals and Services</h3>
<p>Unit 1 developed a foundational understanding of cloud computing, focusing on its evolution,
core service models, and impact on modern IT. Learning about IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS clarified how
responsibility is distributed between providers and customers, helping to evaluate which model best
suits organisational needs. This unit also encouraged reflection on the balance between scalability,
cost efficiency, and security, which often determine successful adoption. The formative discussion
comparing AWS and Google Cloud deepened this insight by contrasting flexibility, pricing, and use
cases. It became clear that provider selection depends less on brand and more on aligning
capabilities with strategic goals and workload demands.</p>

        <h3>Unit 2 – Understanding Cloud Architecture and Implementing Frameworks</h3>
<p>Unit 2 strengthened architectural thinking by linking strategic frameworks to practical
implementation. Analysing TOGAF illustrated how governance and enterprise alignment form the
backbone of effective cloud design, while the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) emphasised
disciplined progression through planning, testing, and deployment. Exploring Infrastructure as Code
(IaC) demonstrated how automation translates architecture into repeatable, auditable
configurations. The formative discussion reviewing Anggraini, Binariswanto, and Legowo (2019)
highlighted how ROCCA complements TOGAF in structured environments, such as the government.
Reflecting on this integration underscores that successful architecture combines strategic governance
with flexible execution, ensuring both compliance and adaptability in cloud projects..</p>

        <h3>Unit 3 – Cloud Design Tools</h3>
<p>Unit 3 introduced Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a transformative force in cloud management.
Through learning about AI-driven automation, optimisation, and predictive analytics, the importance
of using data to manage capacity, cost, and performance proactively became evident. AI’s potential
to strengthen cloud security and monitoring encouraged reflection on how automation supports
resilience while reducing human error. The unit connected theory to practical planning for future
workloads that can self-adjust to demand. The formative discussion evaluated cloud design tools,
concluding that Microsoft Visio offers advantages through strong Microsoft 365 integration,
collaborative architecture modelling, and governance support, reinforcing how tool selection shapes
clarity and communication in system design.</p>


<h3>Unit 4 – Cloud Native Technology (Part 1)</h3>
<p>Unit 4 moved from theory to practical application through scripting and automation. Working
with Bash and Python highlighted how scripting enforces consistency, reduces manual intervention,
and enables scalable management across cloud resources. Exploring OpenStack demonstrated how
open-source platforms provide flexibility for custom deployment and hybrid integration, while GUI
based tools offer user-friendly control for routine tasks. Reflection on this experience revealed that
automation is not just a technical convenience, it is essential for operational efficiency and
compliance. The formative discussion involved designing and executing a Bash script to automate
provisioning on OpenStack, reinforcing the value of code-driven management and repeatable
infrastructure builds.</p>

        <h3>Unit 5 – Cloud Native Technology (Part 2)</h3>
<p>Unit 5 deepened understanding of cloud-native development through the 12-Factor App
methodology and container orchestration with Kubernetes. Applying these principles showed how
loosely coupled, stateless applications simplify scaling and deployment. Setting up a local Kubernetes
cluster and managing containers revealed both the power and complexity of orchestration, especially
the need for observability and robust configuration management. Reflection on this unit clarified
that true scalability depends on aligning development practices with infrastructure automation. The
formative discussion required deploying a 12-Factor App using Docker and Kubernetes, which
provided hands-on insight into packaging, deploying, and maintaining applications that can adapt to
demand without compromising reliability.</p>

<h3>Unit 6 – Hybrid Cloud, Fog, and Edge Computing</h3>
<p>Unit 6 broadened understanding by exploring hybrid, fog, and edge computing as extensions of
cloud strategy. Hybrid models were recognised as essential for balancing compliance, performance,
and cost, especially in sectors handling sensitive data. Fog and edge technologies illustrated how
moving computation closer to data sources improves latency and real-time responsiveness.
Reflection on the risks of vendor lock-in and multi-cloud complexity highlighted the importance of
open standards and portability in long-term planning. The unit concluded with a team assignment
evaluating Microsoft Azure Resource Manager. This collaboration strengthened critical understanding
of how governance frameworks underpin hybrid architectures and how real-world implementations
achieve both control and agility.</p>

        <h3>Unit 7 – Cloud Security and Compliance</h3>
<p>Unit 7 strengthened understanding of security and compliance as core components of cloud
governance rather than afterthoughts. The learning explored the shared responsibility model,
encryption, identity management, and vulnerability assessment techniques aligned with ISO/IEC
27001 and GDPR. Evaluating these standards encouraged reflection on how security controls must be
embedded throughout system design to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability. A key
insight was recognising that compliance is continuously maintained through monitoring, patching,
and audit readiness. The formative discussion involved performing a security audit on an OpenStack
application using OpenVAS, identifying vulnerabilities, recommending mitigations, and mapping
results to ISO/IEC 27001 controls, reinforcing the value of structured, standards-based assurance.</p>

<h3>Unit 8 – Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity</h3>
<p>Unit 8 focused on the design and implementation of disaster recovery (DR) and business
continuity strategies to maintain service availability during outages or system failures. The learning
emphasised the importance of defining Recovery Time Objectives (RTO) and Recovery Point
Objectives (RPO) to balance performance, resilience, and cost. Exploring cloud-based tools such as
Azure Site Recovery and AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery provided perspective on automated
replication and failover solutions. The practical activity on OpenStack involved simulating a failure
scenario and performing recovery using open-source tools like Bacula and Duplicity. The exercise
demonstrated how planning, automation, and regular testing underpin a reliable recovery strategy
and strengthen organisational resilience.</p>
