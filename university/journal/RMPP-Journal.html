        <h2>Journal Overview</h2>
        <p>This journal documents key learnings, reflections, and experiences gained during the Research Methods and Professional Practice module.</p>
 <h3>Unit 1: Introduction to Research Methods – The Scientific Investigation and Ethics in Computing. </h3>
<p>Unit 1 introduced the fundamental concepts of research within computing, focusing on how the
scientific method provides a structured and logical approach to investigation. I developed a deeper
understanding of inductive and deductive reasoning and how both contribute to building and testing
ideas through evidence-based inquiry. The unit also emphasised the importance of ethics in
research, particularly when engaging with participants or managing sensitive data. Learning about
the Menlo Report strengthened my awareness of the need for respect, fairness, care, and
accountability, while the BCS Code of Conduct highlighted the role of professionalism and integrity in
maintaining responsible IT practices. Exploring the ACM Code of Ethics provided a broader
international perspective. Participating in the three-week discussion across Units 1–3 helped deepen
these concepts through collaborative reflection, where applying ethical principles to real-world case
studies enhanced my understanding of professional standards in computing. Overall, this unit
strengthened my understanding of research as a process guided by both analytical thinking and
ethical responsibility.</p>
