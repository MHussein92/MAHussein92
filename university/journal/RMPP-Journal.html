        <h2>Journal Overview</h2>
        <p>This journal documents key learnings, reflections, and experiences gained during the Research Methods and Professional Practice module.</p>
 <h3>Unit 1: Introduction to Research Methods – The Scientific Investigation and Ethics in Computing. </h3>
<p>Unit 1 introduced the core principles of research within computing, focusing on how the
scientific method supports structured and logical investigation. I developed a stronger understanding
of inductive and deductive reasoning, and how each contributes to forming and testing ideas through
evidence-based thinking. The unit also highlighted the importance of ethics, particularly when
handling sensitive data or involving participants. Learning about the Menlo Report helped me
understand the need for respect, fairness, care, and accountability, while the BCS Code of Conduct
reinforced professionalism and integrity in IT practice.</p>
<p>The assessment element introduced the process of selecting a topic for the literature review and
presentation, requiring the choice of a subject from a pre-approved list. I selected Ethics in
Computing in the Age of Generative AI, as it aligns closely with my professional interests and explores
how emerging technologies challenge existing ethical frameworks. This encouraged early reflection
on research design and ethical considerations in modern computing. Participating in the three-week
discussion across Units 1–3 further developed my understanding through collaboration and practical
reflection. Overall, this unit enhanced my awareness of how research combines analytical thinking
with ethical responsibility and professional standards in computing.</p>
