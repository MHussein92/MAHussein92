        <h2>Journal Overview</h2>
        <p>This journal documents key learnings, reflections, and experiences gained during the Research Methods and Professional Practice module.</p>
 <h3>Unit 1: Introduction to Research Methods – The Scientific Investigation and Ethics in Computing. </h3>
<p>Unit 1 introduced the core principles of research within computing, focusing on how the
scientific method supports structured and logical investigation. I developed a stronger understanding
of inductive and deductive reasoning, and how each contributes to forming and testing ideas through
evidence-based thinking. The unit also highlighted the importance of ethics, particularly when
handling sensitive data or involving participants. Learning about the Menlo Report helped me
understand the need for respect, fairness, care, and accountability, while the BCS Code of Conduct
reinforced professionalism and integrity in IT practice.</p>
<p>The assessment element introduced the process of selecting a topic for the literature review and
presentation, requiring the choice of a subject from a pre-approved list. I selected Ethics in
Computing in the Age of Generative AI, as it aligns closely with my professional interests and explores
how emerging technologies challenge existing ethical frameworks. This encouraged early reflection
on research design and ethical considerations in modern computing. Participating in the three-week
discussion across Units 1–3 further developed my understanding through collaboration and practical
reflection. Overall, this unit enhanced my awareness of how research combines analytical thinking
with ethical responsibility and professional standards in computing.</p>

<h3>Unit 2 – Research Questions, the Literature Review and the Research Proposal.</h3>
<p>Unit 2 focused on developing the skills needed to turn initial research ideas into clear and
achievable questions that form the basis of a strong proposal. I learned how a well-structured
literature review helps identify relevant theories, highlight research gaps, and justify the importance
of a chosen topic. The peer review activity was especially useful, as it allowed me to evaluate others’
work while improving my own through constructive feedback. This process encouraged more critical
thinking about the structure, scope, and clarity of my proposal. The unit also emphasised the
importance of careful planning, using credible academic sources, and maintaining ethical standards
throughout the research process to ensure integrity and quality in academic writing.</p>

<h3>Unit 3 – Methodology and Research Methods.</h3>
<p>Unit 3 explored the foundations of research methodology and the importance of selecting the
right approach to support a research question. I learned how assumptions such as ontology,
epistemology, and axiology shape the way researchers interpret data and design their studies. The
unit helped me differentiate between exploratory and conclusive research, as well as between
qualitative, quantitative, and mixed-method approaches. Understanding how each method
influences data collection and analysis improved my confidence in identifying which strategy suits
different research aims. The seminar’s peer review activity was particularly helpful, as evaluating
papers that used different research methods allowed me to see how methodology affects credibility
and outcomes. This process also encouraged more critical thinking about the strengths and
limitations of each research approach and how I can apply them in my own project.</p>

<h3>Unit 4 – Case Studies, Focus Groups and Observations.</h3>
<p>Unit 4 explored various qualitative data collection methods, including case studies, focus groups, and
observations. I learned how these approaches can provide deeper insights into human behaviour
and experiences, which are often difficult to capture through quantitative methods alone. The focus
on selecting appropriate participants for focus groups and ensuring unbiased observation helped me
appreciate the importance of careful planning in qualitative research. I also found it interesting how
some of these methods, such as observations and surveys, can overlap with quantitative research
when data is measured numerically. Submitting the outline of my literature review this week was a
valuable step, as the formative feedback will help refine my focus and improve the structure of my
final submission in Unit 7. Overall, this unit strengthened my understanding of how to gather
meaningful data using the most suitable research techniques.</p>

<h3>Unit 5 – Interviews, Survey Methods, and Questionnaire Design</h3>
<p>Unit 5 introduced practical methods for collecting data through interviews, surveys, and
questionnaires, highlighting the strengths and challenges of each approach. I learned how interviews
allow for deeper qualitative insights, while surveys and questionnaires are better suited for
quantitative data that can be analysed statistically. Understanding the distinction between a
questionnaire (a set of questions) and a survey (a full process of data collection and analysis) was
particularly useful, especially in designing effective research tools. The reflective activity on the
Cambridge Analytica case emphasised the ethical responsibilities researchers hold when handling
personal data. It showed how poorly designed or misused surveys can lead to serious privacy and
legal issues, reinforcing the importance of transparency and consent in research. This unit also
helped me appreciate how careful question design and ethical awareness ensure that data collection
supports valid, reliable, and responsible research outcomes.</p>

<h3>Unit 6 – Quantitative Methods: Descriptive and Inferential Statistics</h3>
<p>Unit 6 provided a clear introduction to quantitative research and how data can be used to
identify relationships between variables. I learned the importance of understanding different levels
of measurement and how they influence the choice of statistical techniques. The distinction between
descriptive and inferential statistics were particularly useful, as they showed how descriptive methods
summarise data through measures such as mean and standard deviation, while using inferential statistics
allow for broader conclusions about a population. I also gained a better appreciation for how
graphical summaries can make data patterns easier to interpret, laying the foundation for data
visualisation later in the module. Overall, this unit strengthened my analytical thinking and improved
my confidence in working with numerical data, which will be valuable when analysing results in my
own research project.</p>

<h3>Unit 7 – Inferential Statistics and Hypothesis Testing</h3>
<p>Unit 7 expanded my understanding of quantitative research by introducing inferential statistics and
hypothesis testing, both essential for drawing meaningful conclusions from data. I learned how
statistical inference allows researchers to make predictions about a population using a smaller
sample, and how probability underpins this process. The concept of hypothesis testing was
particularly insightful, as it demonstrated how evidence can be used to test assumptions objectively
rather than relying on estimation alone. Completing the Hypothesis Testing and Summary Measures
worksheet was useful for applying these ideas in practice, as it helped me interpret real data and
identify significant relationships.</p>

<p>The discussion on the case study “Accuracy of Information” raised important ethical questions
about the manipulation of data and professional integrity in research. It made me reflect on the
responsibility researchers must report results honestly, even when findings challenge expectations or
external pressures. </p>
<p>Submitting the literature review assignment also reinforced the importance of critical evaluation
and ethical practice when reviewing research methodologies and data analysis in the computing
field. Overall, this unit strengthened both my statistical knowledge and my understanding of
professional accountability in data-driven research.</p>

<h3>Unit 8 – Data Analysis and Visualisation</h3>
<p>Unit 8 deepened my understanding of how to make sense of both qualitative and quantitative
data, with a particular focus on data analysis and presentation. I learned how qualitative data
requires careful interpretation and coding to identify patterns and themes, while quantitative data is
often summarised using descriptive statistics and visualised through charts or dashboards. This
distinction highlighted the importance of objectivity and consistency when working with qualitative responses.</p>
<p>The introduction to data visualisation and business intelligence was especially valuable, as it
showed how dashboards transform raw data into meaningful insights using tools like Excel or PowerBI. 
Completing the Charts Worksheet and Analysis helped me apply these principles by creating clear,
informative visuals that support decision-making. Continuing the peer discussion from Unit 7 also
enhanced my ability to evaluate others’ analytical approaches and give constructive feedback. Finally,
preparing a brief outline for my research proposal on Cloud-Based Device Management and
Organisational Security helped me connect data analysis concepts to my chosen research topic,
reinforcing how effective analysis and visualisation strengthen the overall quality and impact of
academic and professional research.</p>

<h3>Unit 9 – Validity and Generalisability in Research</h3>
<p>Unit 9 highlighted the importance of validity, reliability, and generalisability in ensuring that
research findings are credible and meaningful. I learned that reliability relates to the consistency of
measurement, while validity determines whether the research truly measures what it intends to.
Both concepts are essential for drawing sound conclusions, and they must be considered early in the
research design. The unit also emphasised generalisability, which ensures that findings can be
applied beyond the immediate sample studied.</p>
<p>Understanding the balance between qualitative and quantitative data analysis further
developed my appreciation of how different data types require distinct approaches to maintain
accuracy and objectivity. Engaging with the Power BI visualisation exercise reinforced how effective
data presentation can improve clarity and interpretation. Completing the summary post for the Unit
7 discussion encouraged me to critically evaluate peer feedback, deepening my awareness of
research quality. Overall, this unit strengthened my ability to design robust and trustworthy research
by recognising how methodological rigour and clear data presentation contribute to credible outcomes.</p>

<h3>Unit 10 – Research Writing</h3>
<p>Unit 10 focused on developing the essential skills for producing and presenting structured
academic research. This was particularly valuable as it prepared me for the research proposal
presentation based on my chosen topic, The Impact of Cloud-Based Device Management on Security
and Operational Efficiency in Organisations. The unit deepened my understanding of how to organise
and communicate research effectively, ensuring that each section, from aims and objectives to
methodology and ethical considerations, was logically connected.</p>
<p>Completing the e-Portfolio Activity: Statistical Worksheet Submissions strengthened my ability
to interpret data accurately and integrate analytical findings into my proposal. Preparing the audio
narrated presentation and transcript also helped me combine technical content with visual
storytelling, improving my ability to engage an academic audience. Overall, this unit refined both my
writing and presentation skills, enabling me to present complex ideas in a clear, professional, and
academically sound manner, while reinforcing the connection between rigorous data analysis and
effective communication in research.</p>
