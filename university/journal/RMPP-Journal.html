        <h2>Journal Overview</h2>
        <p>This journal documents key learnings, reflections, and experiences gained during the Research Methods and Professional Practice module.</p>
 <h3>Unit 1: Introduction to Research Methods – The Scientific Investigation and Ethics in Computing. </h3>
<p>Unit 1 introduced the core principles of research within computing, focusing on how the
scientific method supports structured and logical investigation. I developed a stronger understanding
of inductive and deductive reasoning, and how each contributes to forming and testing ideas through
evidence-based thinking. The unit also highlighted the importance of ethics, particularly when
handling sensitive data or involving participants. Learning about the Menlo Report helped me
understand the need for respect, fairness, care, and accountability, while the BCS Code of Conduct
reinforced professionalism and integrity in IT practice.</p>
<p>The assessment element introduced the process of selecting a topic for the literature review and
presentation, requiring the choice of a subject from a pre-approved list. I selected Ethics in
Computing in the Age of Generative AI, as it aligns closely with my professional interests and explores
how emerging technologies challenge existing ethical frameworks. This encouraged early reflection
on research design and ethical considerations in modern computing. Participating in the three-week
discussion across Units 1–3 further developed my understanding through collaboration and practical
reflection. Overall, this unit enhanced my awareness of how research combines analytical thinking
with ethical responsibility and professional standards in computing.</p>

<h3>Unit 2 – Research Questions, the Literature Review and the Research Proposal.</h3>
<p>Unit 2 focused on developing the skills needed to turn initial research ideas into clear and
achievable questions that form the basis of a strong proposal. I learned how a well-structured
literature review helps identify relevant theories, highlight research gaps, and justify the importance
of a chosen topic. The peer review activity was especially useful, as it allowed me to evaluate others’
work while improving my own through constructive feedback. This process encouraged more critical
thinking about the structure, scope, and clarity of my proposal. The unit also emphasised the
importance of careful planning, using credible academic sources, and maintaining ethical standards
throughout the research process to ensure integrity and quality in academic writing.</p>

<h3>Unit 3 – Methodology and Research Methods.</h3>
<p>Unit 3 explored the foundations of research methodology and the importance of selecting the
right approach to support a research question. I learned how assumptions such as ontology,
epistemology, and axiology shape the way researchers interpret data and design their studies. The
unit helped me differentiate between exploratory and conclusive research, as well as between
qualitative, quantitative, and mixed-method approaches. Understanding how each method
influences data collection and analysis improved my confidence in identifying which strategy suits
different research aims. The seminar’s peer review activity was particularly helpful, as evaluating
papers that used different research methods allowed me to see how methodology affects credibility
and outcomes. This process also encouraged more critical thinking about the strengths and
limitations of each research approach and how I can apply them in my own project.</p>

<h3>Unit 4 – Case Studies, Focus Groups and Observations</h3>
<p>Unit 4 explored various qualitative data collection methods, including case studies, focus groups, and
observations. I learned how these approaches can provide deeper insights into human behaviour
and experiences, which are often difficult to capture through quantitative methods alone. The focus
on selecting appropriate participants for focus groups and ensuring unbiased observation helped me
appreciate the importance of careful planning in qualitative research. I also found it interesting how
some of these methods, such as observations and surveys, can overlap with quantitative research
when data is measured numerically. Submitting the outline of my literature review this week was a
valuable step, as the formative feedback will help refine my focus and improve the structure of my
final submission in Unit 7. Overall, this unit strengthened my understanding of how to gather
meaningful data using the most suitable research techniques.</p>
