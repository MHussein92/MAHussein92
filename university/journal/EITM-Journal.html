        <h2>Journal Overview</h2>
        <p>This journal documents key learnings, reflections, and experiences gained during the Enterprise IT Project Management module.</p>

        <h3>Unit 1: Introduction to ETI</h3>
        <p>In Week 1, the fundamentals of Enterprise IT (EIT) were thoroughly examined, differentiating it from
related concepts such as Business Information Systems and Industry 4.0/5.0. Key EIT concepts,
including its historical evolution and the EIT knowledge tree, were explored. The interactions
between EIT and standards such as TOGAF and ITIL, as well as bodies of knowledge (BOKs) like
PMBOK and SEBOK, were also analysed. By the end of the week, a comprehensive understanding of
EIT's definition and applications was developed, relevant BOKs for EIT practitioners were identified,
and transformative EIT components that have influenced business practices were reviewed.

        <h3>Unit 2: EIT vs. Shadow IT</h3>
        <p>In Week 2, we examined the contrast between Enterprise IT (EIT) and Shadow IT. EIT refers to
officially sanctioned technologies governed by formal processes, while Shadow IT encompasses
unsanctioned, often ad hoc solutions that can drive innovation but also pose risks. We discussed
sources of Shadow IT, reasons for its adoption, and its potential benefits and drawbacks. This week’s
insights highlighted the balance between leveraging the creativity of Shadow IT and managing its
associated risks. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for businesses to effectively evaluate and
integrate Shadow IT while ensuring security and compliance.
</p>

        <h3>Unit 3: EIT and Automation</h3>
        <p>In Week 3, we explored the relationship between Enterprise IT (EIT) and automation, tracing
automation's historical roots and its evolution with computer systems. We examined how
automation, facilitated by programming languages, enhances business processes and contributes to
digital transformation. Key topics included the use of various programming languages for
automation, with a focus on BASIC in office settings, and how automation aligns with Industry 4.0
and 5.0. The week's discussions emphasised the strategic application of automated systems to
streamline operations, select appropriate languages for specific tasks, and understand automation's
role in advancing modern industry practices and sustainability.
</p>
        <h3>Unit 4: A Comparative Study: Practical Automation Exercises using C and Python</h3>
        <p>In Week 4, practical programming exercises focused on implementing and analysing a sorting
algorithm using Python and C. The activities provided insights into how compiled and interpreted
languages influence performance and the role of algorithmic optimisation in execution time. By
designing and comparing sorting programs in both languages, the exercise highlighted differences in
performance and the underlying reasons for these variations. This exploration emphasised the
importance of language selection and code optimisation for enhancing efficiency. Additionally, the
week’s activities related to broader trends in Enterprise IT, including the effects of automation and
emerging technologies on programming practices.
