        <h2>Journal Overview</h2>
        <p>This journal documents key learnings, reflections, and experiences gained during the Enterprise IT Project Management module.</p>

        <h3>Unit 1: Introduction to ETI</h3>
        <p>In Week 1, the fundamentals of Enterprise IT (EIT) were thoroughly examined, differentiating it from
related concepts such as Business Information Systems and Industry 4.0/5.0. Key EIT concepts,
including its historical evolution and the EIT knowledge tree, were explored. The interactions
between EIT and standards such as TOGAF and ITIL, as well as bodies of knowledge (BOKs) like
PMBOK and SEBOK, were also analysed. By the end of the week, a comprehensive understanding of
EIT's definition and applications was developed, relevant BOKs for EIT practitioners were identified,
and transformative EIT components that have influenced business practices were reviewed.

        <h3>Unit 2: EIT vs. Shadow IT</h3>
        <p>In Week 2, In Week 2, The contrast between Enterprise IT (EIT) and Shadow IT was examined. EIT refers to
officially sanctioned technologies that adhere to formal processes, whereas Shadow IT involves
unsanctioned, often ad hoc solutions that can foster innovation but also present risks. The sources of
Shadow IT, reasons for its adoption, and its potential benefits and drawbacks were discussed.
Insights from this week emphasised the need to balance the creative potential of Shadow IT with the
management of associated risks. Understanding these dynamics is essential for businesses to
effectively evaluate and integrate Shadow IT while maintaining security and compliance.
</p>

        <h3>Unit 3: EIT and Automation</h3>
        <p>In Week 3, The relationship between Enterprise IT (EIT) and automation was explored, tracing
automation's historical origins and its evolution alongside computer systems. The examination
focused on how automation, enabled by programming languages, enhances business processes and
drives digital transformation. Key topics included the application of various programming languages
for automation, with particular attention to BASIC in office environments, and the alignment of
automation with Industry 4.0 and 5.0. The discussions underscored the strategic use of automated
systems to streamline operations, select suitable programming languages for specific tasks, and
understand automation's contribution to advancing modern industry practices and sustainability.
</p>
        <h3>Unit 4: A Comparative Study: Practical Automation Exercises using C and Python</h3>
        <p>In Week 4, practical programming exercises focused on implementing and analysing a sorting
algorithm using Python and C. The activities provided insights into how compiled and interpreted
languages influence performance and the role of algorithmic optimisation in execution time. By
designing and comparing sorting programs in both languages, the exercise highlighted differences in
performance and the underlying reasons for these variations. This exploration emphasised the
importance of language selection and code optimisation for enhancing efficiency. Additionally, the
weekâ€™s activities related to broader trends in Enterprise IT, including the effects of automation and
emerging technologies on programming practices.
</p>

        
        <h3>Unit 5: Business Systems, Outsourcing and the Cloud</h3>
        <p>In Week 5, the focus was on the evolution of business systems, the dynamics of outsourcing, and the
emergence of cloud systems as a transformative force. The discussion encompassed the
development of business systems, including the various models and technologies. Outsourcing, along
with its variants such as offshoring and nearshoring, was examined, highlighting the benefits and
challenges associated with each approach. The week also covered public Cloud Solution Providers
(CSPs), exploring the advantages and disadvantages of cloud hosting and computing. Insights gained
from this week provided a comprehensive understanding of the impact of these systems and
strategies on modern business practices.
