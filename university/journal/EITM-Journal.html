        <h3>Week 1: Introduction to Enterprise IT Project Management</h3>
        <p>In Week 1, we delved into the fundamentals of Enterprise IT (EIT), distinguishing it from related concepts like Business Information Systems and Industry 4/5.0. We explored key EIT concepts, including its historical evolution and the EIT knowledge tree. The week also covered the interplay between EIT and standards such as TOGAF and ITIL, as well as bodies of knowledge (BOKs) like PMBOK and SEBOK. By the end of the week, we gained insights into the definition and applications of EIT, identified relevant BOKs for EIT practitioners, and examined transformative EIT components that have reshaped businesses.</p>
