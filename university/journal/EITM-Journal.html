        <h2>Journal Overview</h2>
        <p>This journal documents key learnings, reflections, and experiences gained during the Enterprise IT Project Management module.</p>

        <h3>Unit 1: Introduction to ETI</h3>
        <p>In Week 1, we delved into the fundamentals of Enterprise IT (EIT), distinguishing it from related
concepts like Business Information Systems and Industry 4/5.0. We explored key EIT concepts,
including its historical evolution and the EIT knowledge tree. The week also covered the interplay
between EIT and standards such as TOGAF and ITIL, as well as bodies of knowledge (BOKs) like
PMBOK and SEBOK. By the end of the week, we gained insights into the definition and applications of
EIT, identified relevant BOKs for EIT practitioners, and examined transformative EIT components that
have reshaped businesses.
</p>

        <h3>Unit 2: EIT vs. Shadow IT</h3>
        <p>In Week 2, we examined the contrast between Enterprise IT (EIT) and Shadow IT. EIT refers to
officially sanctioned technologies governed by formal processes, while Shadow IT encompasses
unsanctioned, often ad hoc solutions that can drive innovation but also pose risks. We discussed
sources of Shadow IT, reasons for its adoption, and its potential benefits and drawbacks. This weekâ€™s
insights highlighted the balance between leveraging the creativity of Shadow IT and managing its
associated risks. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for businesses to effectively evaluate and
integrate Shadow IT while ensuring security and compliance.
