        <h2>Journal Overview</h2>
        <p>This journal documents the key learnings, reflections, and experiences gained during the Security and Risk Management module.</p>

        <h3>Unit 1: Introduction to Security and Risk Management</h3>
        <p>Unit 1 offered an introduction to security and risk management by exploring foundational definitions
and concepts. The unit reviewed key definitions of risk, discussed the risk management process, and
introduced methods for assessing, qualifying, and mitigating risks. Various approaches to quantifying
and qualifying risks were examined, alongside common security and risk standards. The insights
gained from this unit, along with the accompanying lecture cast, are essential for understanding and
applying qualitative and quantitative risk assessments in future contexts. This foundational
knowledge will facilitate more effective risk management and security measures in practical
scenarios.
</p>
        <h3>Unit 2: Users, Assessments and the Risk Management Process</h3>
        <p>Unit 2 delves deeper into the Risk Management Process (RMP), focusing on the distinctions between
qualitative and quantitative assessments and the critical role of user participation. The unit highlights
how different assessment methods impact the RMP and underscore the necessity of engaging users
throughout the process. The seminar provides a platform to reflect on the importance of these
assessment approaches and user involvement, fostering a more comprehensive understanding of
how these factors influence risk mitigation strategies. The knowledge gained is essential for
effectively tailoring the RMP to specific contexts, ensuring more accurate and participatory risk
management practices.

     <h3>Unit 3: Introduction to Threat Modelling and Management</h3> 
     <p>Unit 3 provides an in-depth exploration of threat modelling and management, distinguishing
between threats and vulnerabilities while introducing key modelling techniques such as STRIDE,
DREAD, Attack Trees, and hybrid models like PASTA. The unit emphasises the importance of selecting
appropriate frameworks tailored to specific scenarios, supported by guides and cookbooks for
practical application. Understanding these methodologies equips students with the ability to identify,
assess, and manage threats effectively, ensuring robust security strategies. The insights gained from
this unit is crucial for advising on the best threat modelling techniques and determining when to
employ hybrid models for enhanced security management.
</h3>
  
<h3>Unit 4: Application of Threat Modelling and Management Techniques</h3> 
     <p>Unit 4 focuses on the practical application of threat modelling and management techniques, utilising
resources such as the Threat Modelling Manifesto, the OWASP Cookbook, and the Mitre ATT&CK
database. The unit provides an overview of various tools and resources available for threat
modelling, evaluates their effectiveness, and offers guidance on selecting appropriate tools for
specific scenarios. By creating threat models based on given scenarios, students gain critical insights
into the application and evaluation of these tools. Mastery of these techniques is essential for
professionals in cybersecurity and development, underpinning effective threat management and
mitigation strategies.

        <h3>Unit 5: An Introduction to Security and Risk Standards in Industry and the Enterprise</h3> 
     <p>Unit 5 provides an in-depth exploration of industry and enterprise security and risk standards,
emphasising their significance in risk assessments and designs. The module examines various
industry-specific standards, the implications of these standards on security practices, and their
integration into threat models. By understanding and applying these standards, professionals can
enhance risk management strategies and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements. The unit
also includes practical exercises, such as analysing GDPR case studies, to illustrate the application of
security standards in real-world scenarios and develop strategies for effective risk mitigation. </h3>
