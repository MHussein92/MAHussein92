        <h2>Journal Overview</h2>
        <p>This journal documents the key learnings, reflections, and experiences gained during the Security and Risk Management module.</p>

        <h3>Unit 1: Introduction to Security and Risk Management</h3>
        <p>Unit 1 offered an introduction to security and risk management by exploring foundational definitions
and concepts. The unit reviewed key definitions of risk, discussed the risk management process, and
introduced methods for assessing, qualifying, and mitigating risks. Various approaches to quantifying
and qualifying risks were examined, alongside common security and risk standards. The insights
gained from this unit, along with the accompanying lecture cast, are essential for understanding and
applying qualitative and quantitative risk assessments in future contexts. This foundational
knowledge will facilitate more effective risk management and security measures in practical
scenarios.
</p>
        <h3>Unit 2: Users, Assessments and the Risk Management Process</h3>
        <p>Reflecting on Unit 2, we conducted an in-depth exploration of the Risk Management Process (RMP), focusing on the impact of qualitative versus quantitative assessments. We examined how these different types of assessments influence risk evaluation and decision-making. The unit highlighted the crucial role of user participation in the RMP, emphasizing that active engagement can significantly affect the process's effectiveness and adaptability. 
By reviewing how changes in user involvement can alter the RMP, we gained insights into optimizing risk management practices. This unit reinforced the importance of incorporating diverse assessment methods and user feedback to enhance overall risk management strategies.</h3>
