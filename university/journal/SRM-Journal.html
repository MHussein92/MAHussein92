        <h2>Journal Overview</h2>
        <p>This journal documents the key learnings, reflections, and experiences gained during the Security and Risk Management module.</p>

        <h3>Unit 1: Introduction to Security and Risk Management</h3>
        <p>Reflecting on Unit 1, I've gained a solid understanding of the critical elements in security and risk management. The unit clarified how essential it is to distinguish between risks, threats, and vulnerabilities within information systems. 
I now appreciate the complexity of the risk management process, particularly the importance of accurately assessing and mitigating risks. Learning about various methods to quantify and qualify risks, as well as how to select suitable risk standards, was particularly valuable. These insights will be crucial as I apply these principles in real-world scenarios, ensuring effective protection of information systems.</p>
        <h3>Unit 2: Users, Assessments and the Risk Management Process</h3>
        <p>Reflecting on Unit 2, we conducted an in-depth exploration of the Risk Management Process (RMP), focusing on the impact of qualitative versus quantitative assessments. We examined how these different types of assessments influence risk evaluation and decision-making. The unit highlighted the crucial role of user participation in the RMP, emphasizing that active engagement can significantly affect the process's effectiveness and adaptability. 
By reviewing how changes in user involvement can alter the RMP, we gained insights into optimizing risk management practices. This unit reinforced the importance of incorporating diverse assessment methods and user feedback to enhance overall risk management strategies.</h3>
