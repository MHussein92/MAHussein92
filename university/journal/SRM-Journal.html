        <h2>Journal Overview</h2>
        <p>This journal documents the key learnings, reflections, and experiences gained during the Security and Risk Management module.</p>

        <h3>Unit 1: Introduction to Security and Risk Management</h3>
        <p>Unit 1 offered an introduction to security and risk management by exploring foundational definitions
and concepts. The unit reviewed key definitions of risk, discussed the risk management process, and
introduced methods for assessing, qualifying, and mitigating risks. Various approaches to quantifying
and qualifying risks were examined, alongside common security and risk standards. The insights
gained from this unit, along with the accompanying lecture cast, are essential for understanding and
applying qualitative and quantitative risk assessments in future contexts. This foundational
knowledge will facilitate more effective risk management and security measures in practical
scenarios.
</p>
        <h3>Unit 2: Users, Assessments and the Risk Management Process</h3>
        <p>Unit 2 delves deeper into the Risk Management Process (RMP), focusing on the distinctions between
qualitative and quantitative assessments and the critical role of user participation. The unit highlights
how different assessment methods impact the RMP and underscore the necessity of engaging users
throughout the process. The seminar provides a platform to reflect on the importance of these
assessment approaches and user involvement, fostering a more comprehensive understanding of
how these factors influence risk mitigation strategies. The knowledge gained is essential for
effectively tailoring the RMP to specific contexts, ensuring more accurate and participatory risk
management practices.

     <h3>Unit 3: Introduction to Threat Modelling and Management</h3> 
     <p>Unit 3 provides an in-depth exploration of threat modelling and management, distinguishing
between threats and vulnerabilities while introducing key modelling techniques such as STRIDE,
DREAD, Attack Trees, and hybrid models like PASTA. The unit emphasises the importance of selecting
appropriate frameworks tailored to specific scenarios, supported by guides and cookbooks for
practical application. Understanding these methodologies equips students with the ability to identify,
assess, and manage threats effectively, ensuring robust security strategies. The insights gained from
this unit is crucial for advising on the best threat modelling techniques and determining when to
employ hybrid models for enhanced security management.
</h3>
  
<h3>Unit 4: Application of Threat Modelling and Management Techniques</h3> 
     <p>Unit 4 focuses on the practical application of threat modelling and management techniques, utilising
resources such as the Threat Modelling Manifesto, the OWASP Cookbook, and the Mitre ATT&CK
database. The unit provides an overview of various tools and resources available for threat
modelling, evaluates their effectiveness, and offers guidance on selecting appropriate tools for
specific scenarios. By creating threat models based on given scenarios, students gain critical insights
into the application and evaluation of these tools. Mastery of these techniques is essential for
professionals in cybersecurity and development, underpinning effective threat management and
mitigation strategies.

        <h3>Unit 5: An Introduction to Security and Risk Standards in Industry and the Enterprise</h3> 
     <p>Unit 5 provides an in-depth exploration of industry and enterprise security and risk standards,
emphasising their significance in risk assessments and designs. The module examines various
industry-specific standards, the implications of these standards on security practices, and their
integration into threat models. By understanding and applying these standards, professionals can
enhance risk management strategies and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements. The unit
also includes practical exercises, such as analysing GDPR case studies, to illustrate the application of
security standards in real-world scenarios and develop strategies for effective risk mitigation. </h3>

<h3>Unit 6: The Practical Implications of Security and Risk Standards</h3> 
     <p>Unit 6 delves into the practical implications of security and risk standards, particularly focusing on
GDPR compliance across various industries. Through the analysis of case studies and industry-specific
standards, the module emphasises the critical role of regulatory frameworks in shaping risk
management strategies. The unit highlights the importance of selecting the appropriate standards
and developing effective mitigation plans to ensure compliance. A Development Team Project: Risk
Identification Report was also submitted, reinforcing the practical application of theoretical concepts
in real-world scenarios. This project further solidifies the understanding of integrating standards into
risk management processes.

<h3>Unit 7: An Introduction to the Concepts of Quantitative Risk Modelling</h3> 
     <p>RUnit 7 introduces quantitative risk modelling (QRM) by exploring probabilistic approaches such as
Monte Carlo simulations and Bayes theorem-based methods, alongside decision analysis techniques
like TOPSIS, AHP, and ANP. The unit focuses on selecting appropriate methods for risk modelling
based on specific real-world scenarios and critically evaluating each approach's advantages and
limitations. In addition, an initial post was submitted for the Spring et al. (2021) reading, addressing
the critique of CVSS characteristics and discussing an alternative model. This unit's content equips
individuals with essential tools to apply QRM techniques effectively in various risk management
contexts. </h3>

<h3>Unit 8: Implementing Quantitative Risk Models.</h3> 
     <p>Unit 8 explores the practical implementation of quantitative risk modelling (QRM) techniques,
specifically focusing on Monte Carlo simulations and Bayes Theorem. The unit emphasises the
application of QRM in project management and safety estimation, with critical evaluations of various
techniques. By engaging with real-world case studies, this unit equips individuals with the ability to
select and apply the most appropriate modelling techniques for specific scenarios. A quantitative risk
model was developed and critically appraised. Peer responses were submitted to further discuss the
application of QRM in various contexts, fostering collaborative learning and critical analysis of the
approaches studied.

<h3>Unit 9: Risk, Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery</h3> 
     <p>Unit 9 covers the critical aspects of business continuity (BC) and disaster recovery (DR) planning,
focusing on key elements such as Business Impact Assessments (BIA), Recovery Time Objectives
(RTO), and Recovery Point Objectives (RPO). The practical importance of creating robust BC and DR
plans is emphasised, along with the exploration of emerging trends in information risk management.
The ability to identify and suggest suitable solutions to meet recovery objectives is a key outcome of
this unit. Additionally, a summary post was submitted as part of a collaborative learning discussion,
further enhancing understanding through peer engagement and reflection.

<h3>Unit 10: Introduction to Threat Modelling and Management</h3> 
     <p>Unit 10 delves into the practical implementation of disaster recovery (DR) solutions, focusing on the
critical role of Recovery Point Objectives (RPO) and Recovery Time Objectives (RTO) in shaping DR
strategies. The unit explores typical system designs to meet standby requirements, along with their
limitations. Additionally, challenges such as vendor lock-in, resilience, and network security are
addressed. A critical review of Disaster Recovery as a Service (DRaaS) highlights its advantages and
disadvantages. Moreover, the completion of activities Part A and B provided hands-on experience in
designing DR solutions that meet specific RPO and RTO criteria, reinforcing theoretical knowledge
with practical application. </h3>
